# 🧾 Intellectual Property Registration DApp (Blockchain)

A simple decentralized application (DApp) for registering and managing intellectual property (IP) using blockchain technology.  
Users can register patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other forms of IP securely on the blockchain.

## ⚙️ Smart Contract Setup 

Before running the DApp, you **must add your own contract ABI and contract address**.

### Steps:
1. Write your Solidity contract (e.g., `ipregistry.sol`).
2. Open **Remix IDE** (browser-based Solidity compiler).
3. Paste your Solidity code into a new file.
4. **Compile** the contract using Remix Compiler.
5. Deploy it to **Sepolia Test Network** using MetaMask.
6. After deployment:
   - Copy the **ABI** → paste it into `abi.js`
   - Copy the **Contract Address** → paste it into `config.js`

Without adding ABI + address, the app cannot interact with the blockchain.
